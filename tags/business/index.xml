      <description>A coworker recently pointed me to an image from a SolutionsIQ blog post The Third Wave of Agile which I’ve included below. The article calls out three areas in Agile thinking - Agile Teams, Agile at Scale, and Business Agility - with key events that either fostered the growth of opinions or reeled them in towards consensus. It’s a good read, one to add to your list after this post. &amp;lt;wink wink&amp;gt;</description>
