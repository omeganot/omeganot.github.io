      <description>Having a retrospective is an important part of the inspect/adapt loop for any team. No matter the batch size of your work, from one item at a time to a month&amp;rsquo;s worth of work, it can be helpful for people to periodically and regularly look at how they&amp;rsquo;re operating and ask what they could change in their personal or work process to make things a bit better. That self introspection can be daunting for many, even with a team of people who work closely with and trust each other.</description>
