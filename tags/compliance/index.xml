      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always a joy to see individuals whose work involves lots of regulation come through Scrum training with questions around process, timing, documentation and so on. These questions highlight very well that Scrum is not the waterfall process they&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to. It makes perfect sense; the language for regulation was written when waterfall was the dominant process. The great thing is, Scrum and compliance already work together better than you may think.</description>
